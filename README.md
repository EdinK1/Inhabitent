# What is this project about?

In this project I built a theme using Wordpress and PHP. The website has lots of pages and uses various plugins. One of my favorite plugins is the block plugin. You can attach a image on it and give it a title and it will show up as a full screen background image with the title in the middle. Another pretty handy plugin I'm using is the business hours plugin. This creates a block in the widgets area and it can be used to display business hours with less than two clicks. There are some other plugins but these two are my favorite.

# Personal learnings

## 1. Learning Wordpress

At first, I had a hard time to wrap my head around Wordpress and how it functions. After a while, I got more familiar with it and while I was building this project, I learned a lot about it. It is a very powerful CMS and I can see why a lot of people use it. The best part about it is that even people who know nothing about coding can build a website. So, after you're done building a custom theme for your client, it makes it really easy for them to change the content of the website without additional help.

## 2. PHP

I used a lot of PHP while working with Wordpress. PHP is an old programming language but it is a very practical one as well. I don't think it's going to die anytime soon. The better I get at PHP, the more I learn to appreciate how practical it is. I am definitely going to continue learning PHP and I think it is a really good programming language overall.

# My notes about the project

This project was very challenging at the beginning. Once I started to connect the dots and understand the structure of the project, it became easier to build it. I used a lot of Wordpress, PHP and Sass and I learned a lot while using them. Another thing with this project was that it actually felt like a real world project. It had a lot of stuff to be done and it can definitely be used as a production website. I am pretty happy with the outcome of this project. Lastly, the stretch goals were really good. I really enjoyed making them and learning even more while completing them.
